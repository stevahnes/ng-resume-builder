    <h1>What is NgResume?</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      NgResume is an automatic and open-source resume generator. It was born out of the frustration
      from having to meddle with document editors whenever it's time to update our resume.
      Acknowledging that there are numerous similar resume generators out there, we designed
      NgResume towards the formats typically accepted in Singapore. We also hope to make it
      open-source, so that anyone with some proficiency in programming can create a pull request and
      upload their own templates. The idea is for NgResume to eventually be a community-driven
      resume generator app!
